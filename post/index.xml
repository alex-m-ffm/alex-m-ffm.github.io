&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveat: You need a computer with a graphics card with a GPU and at least 8GB VRAM. If not you can at least profit from the code-based part in Google Colab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI has taken the world by storm, opening up new realms of creativity and innovation. From chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) to text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion, the possibilities seem boundless. The allure of AI in the art world has captivated enthusiasts, offering a unique blend of technology and creativity. In this blog post, I‚Äôll share my journey of creating AI art of myself using open source models and tools, such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth, and the user-friendly GUI-based tool ‚ÄúAutomatic1111.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-catalyst-a-black-friday-gaming-pc&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Catalyst: A Black Friday Gaming PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Black Friday, I decided invest in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.hp.com/de-de/product/details/omen-by-hp-25l-gaming-desktop-pc-gt15-1000i/model/2101441844?sku=8R2T0EA&#34;&gt;gaming desktop&lt;/a&gt; equipped with a powerful GPU, initially to improve my video editing workflow (which can already be witnessed in my recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/YXaXeL5XsDE&#34;&gt;Thailand travel video&lt;/a&gt;). But one other reason for the investment was that I also wanted to take the plunge into the world of generative AI and be able to test these powerful models locally.This decision was driven by the desire to explore the creative potential of AI models and algorithms, especially those designed for transforming images and generating unique pieces of digital art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;learning-the-ropes&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning the Ropes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with my new gaming laptop, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery through various Udemy courses dedicated to generative AI. In terms of text-to-image models I followed the course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/course/master-ai-image-generation-using-stable-diffusion/?kw=Master+AI+Image&amp;amp;src=sac&#34;&gt;Master AI image generation using Stable Diffusion&lt;/a&gt; which gave a good overview and had excellent Google Colab notebooks with example implementations.
The course provided me with a foundational understanding of the tools and techniques involved in using GenAI. At the time, however, I was still busy with work and looking for a new job so that I could not find sufficient time to test these tools on my new PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;overcoming-hurdles&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overcoming Hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came back to the topic, I wanted to play with image generation models using a graphical user interface (GUI) tool rather than code, since creating these images involves a lot of trial and error and changing settings and that works much better using GUI-based tools with buttons and sliders than adjusting code snippets all the time. On YouTube I stumbled over discussions on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&#34;&gt;Automatic1111&lt;/a&gt; and how to also use Dreambooth to finetune an existing model on new images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3cvP7yJotUM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Nu5tUl2zQw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The initial stages of my exploration were not without their share of hurdles. Wrestling with Python dependencies and configuring the right settings proved to be a daunting task. It took me a while to get things running, in particular installing the &lt;code&gt;xformers&lt;/code&gt; package and needed a few trips through Google &amp;amp; StackOverflow to get it to work (and unfortunately have forgotten by now what was the trick üòÖ), but finally succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I checked out some popular video tutorials by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@OlivioSarikas&#34;&gt;Olivio Sarikas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@SECourses&#34;&gt;Dr.¬†Furkan G√∂z√ºkara&lt;/a&gt;, which helped explaining the menus and settings and the general process to use the Dreambooth extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bdl-jWR3Ukc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, since the videos were produced, Automatic1111 was updated, with changes to the menus and often also to the default options for many settings, making it more difficult to reproduce the results shown in the videos. While I managed to create some interesting pictures using the text-to-image functionality of the models, I was not really able to fine-tune a model to my face, either because the results looked bad or because the process would simply take too long on my system with only 8GB available with my GPU.&lt;br /&gt;
So only recently I took another go at it and remembered that refining with Dreambooth was also featured in the Udemy course I did last year, and revisited the Google Colab notebook to re-run it with my own training data.&lt;br /&gt;
Have a look into &lt;a href=&#34;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jeuzMNWOHys_ciWzOj78daTBmJuqkxAO?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my adjusted copy of that notebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There you can fine-tune the StableDiffusion 1.5 model (or any other model available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image&amp;amp;sort=trending&#34;&gt;HuggingFace&lt;/a&gt;) with your own data. Then you can also copy the created model checkpoint into your Google Drive to later download it to your local machine and use it in Automatic1111.&lt;br /&gt;
One additional step is needed before using the downloaded model locally, which is converting the .ckpt file into a .safetensors file, otherwise Automatic1111 will throw an error, at least it did for me. I used the tool &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/diStyApps/Safe-and-Stable-Ckpt2Safetensors-Conversion-Tool-GUI&#34;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; to perform the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-breakthrough-creating-impressive-ai-art&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Breakthrough: Creating Impressive AI Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After navigating the intricacies of generative AI, I finally achieved a breakthrough, producing impressive AI art of myself using Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth, and the intuitive GUI-based tool ‚ÄúAutomatic1111.‚Äù The amalgamation of these open source models and tools allowed me to transcend traditional boundaries and explore the endless possibilities of self-expression through artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;00011-2157247297.png&#34; style=&#34;width:40.0%&#34; alt=&#34;Prompt: illustration of ohwx man, like obama yes we can poster, realistic, blue and red&#34; /&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;00017-4088469429.png&#34; style=&#34;width:40.0%&#34; alt=&#34;Prompt: (ohwx man) as the simpsons character, glasses&#34; /&gt;¬†
&lt;img src=&#34;00031-4033097712.png&#34; style=&#34;width:40.0%&#34; alt=&#34;Prompt: 2x2 grid of portraits of (ohwx man), popart by Andy Warhol&#34; /&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;00030-1322871741.png&#34; style=&#34;width:40.0%&#34; alt=&#34;(ohwx man) as muppet show character&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learnings so far:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As described in the other tutorials, you should &lt;strong&gt;pay attention to your training data&lt;/strong&gt; having enough variation in terms of &lt;em&gt;angles, lighting, clothing and facial expression&lt;/em&gt;. So in case you don‚Äôt have enough make some ‚Äúselfies‚Äù looking to the side, up etc. Following the video tutorials suggestions I included mostly pictures of me that were from close enough, around from the waist up. However, what I witness in almost all generated images with the generated ‚Äúme‚Äù being smaller and further away is that the face is messed up. So I wonder if this can improve with more images of me being at a higher distance and will try to re-train. But it could also be that this is a general feature of finetuning at lower resolutions (512x512 pixels) and these pictures need to be refined later anyways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to your &lt;strong&gt;prompts&lt;/strong&gt;, make them as detailed as possible and also use negative prompts. There are many websites that give some inspiration for good prompts (e.g.¬†&lt;a href=&#34;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/prompt-guide/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and the Automatic1111 extension ‚ÄúPrompt Generator‚Äù is very useful to create some more ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Colab in the free version is actually not that powerful. During the training process the T4 GPU always used less than 8GB VRAM, which is also what I would have available locally with my GeForce GTX 4070Ti. So I wonder if the issue was simply the different settings. I downloaded the generated .json-files containing the finetuning parameters, so I will try to test these locally again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play around again and again, also testing different settings. The ‚ÄúX/Y/Z‚Äù Script functionality can be a useful tool to test different values for the paramters ‚ÄúCFG Scale‚Äù, ‚ÄúScheduler‚Äù or simply different random seeds. It might be a good idea to generate a larger batch of images using one CFG value, then take the seeds of the pictures you like and then create image grids with different values of CFG Scale to further refine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is still so much more to explore! Additional models, like ControlNets are able to fix common issues like misformed faces or hands (with extra fingers), or upscale the images to higher resolutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey into the world of generative AI art has been a rollercoaster of challenges and triumphs. From acquiring a gaming PC on Black Friday to navigating the complexities of Python and software updates, the experience has been both educational and rewarding. Through perseverance and dedication, I‚Äôve not only learned to harness the power of AI for artistic expression but have also witnessed the transformative potential of these open source models and tools. As the realm of generative AI continues to evolve, so too does the canvas of possibilities for creative individuals eager to explore the intersection of technology and art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: this blog post was co-authored by ChatGPT (GPT 3.5 Turbo), so also expect some post in the near future on LLMs! ;-)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;deloittes-biodiversity-dashboard-lays-the-groundwork-for-data-driven-community-based-conservation&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deloitte‚Äôs Biodiversity Dashboard lays the groundwork for data-driven community-based conservation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my tenure at Deloitte I was so lucky to be leading a small project team working with a large environmental NGO on a pro-bono basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project premise was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Namibia‚Äôs independence in the 1990s, wildlife conservation followed a community-driven approach. Rural communities can declare themselves ‚ÄòCommunal Conservancies‚Äô, a special legal entity with specifically defined geographic boundaries. With this legal status, communities have to commit to specific nature conservation targets and be monitored against them by the government or authorised actors (such as this NGO). In turn they considered sole leaseholders of the land, are allowed to create Safari lodges, heritage villages and allow hunting (in line with quotas) and can keep all profits from tourism for themselves.
With the introduction of the concept the populations of many endangered species in Namibia recovered and the buy-in of communities was strong, with now 86 registered communal conservancies by 2024, covering around 20.2% of the country according to the Association of organisations supporting communities, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nacso.org.na/&#34;&gt;NACSO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the concept showed its weaknesses due to the reliance on tourism income. Without being able to support their livelihoods, communities were more likely to decrease their efforts of conserving flora and fauna.
To provide an additional income source, the client introduced a new program, paying communities directly from donations and development banks for additional &lt;strong&gt;efforts that can be validated by data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The communities and the NGO signed additional contracts relating to specific parts of the community land that should remain free of human interference. Namely, the communities had to record regular ranger surveys into these parcels using a smartphone app, documenting the GPS routes as well as any observations made along the way. Second, communities had to should deploy &lt;strong&gt;camera traps&lt;/strong&gt; to monitor the presence of endangered species. We were then tasked to combine and process this data in a most efficient way to determine whether communities were compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;float&#34;&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;figcaption&#34;&gt;A camera trap; Photo by furkanvari on Unsplash&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We implemented this as a cloud-based solution in AWS, harnessing computer vision models and a business intelligence solution with some custom add-ons.
We also added as a third data source freely available &lt;strong&gt;remote sensing imagery&lt;/strong&gt; from the ESA Sentinel missions, to exclude signs of fire-clearing on the specially designated land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;figcaption&#34;&gt;Remote sensing imagery; Photo by USGS on Unsplash&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my time at the ECB is coming to an end, this SPF report is likely the last one co-authored by me. Given this fact it‚Äôs nice that also content-wise the topic of this survey was a wide-spread sentiment of hope of having the worst behind us, with many respondents even mentioning that there are even upside risks to their baseline forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest survey round, respondents revised up their GDP forecasts across horizons, in the light of the widespread easing of Covid-19 containment measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/survey_of_professional_forecasters/html/ecb.spf2021q3~6a629d9dd3.en.html&#34;&gt;full report on the ECB website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to web-scrape data from multiple pages</title>
      <link>https://alex.melemenidis.de/post/2021-02-10-tutorial-webscraping/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Through my involvement in &lt;a href=&#34;https://correlaid.org/correlaid-x/rhein-main/&#34;&gt;Correlaid Rhein-Main&lt;/a&gt; I received a license to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dataquest.io/&#34;&gt;Dataquest&lt;/a&gt; so I took the opportunity to learn some new tricks! While I skipped most of the beginner classes of the ‚ÄúData Analyst in R‚Äù path, I thought the two courses on &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.dataquest.io/course/apis-in-r&#34;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.dataquest.io/course/scraping-in-r&#34;&gt;web-scraping&lt;/a&gt; might be useful: so far my use of APIs at work mostly was done via packages (or, as in the Bee Observer project, prepared by somebody else), so I was interested to know what‚Äôs behind these &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; commands. While I still had some good learning experiences, I still had the impression that the course had some teething problems and many things were not well explained or described. I will still try to share my comments with the course developers so that hopefully they will improve it for future users - I had done so already via the community page, but apparently this was not the right place‚Ä¶ üòí&lt;br /&gt;
Anyhow‚Ä¶ the web-scraping course was luckily much better in my opinion! üòÉ&lt;br /&gt;
It teaches well how to use the &lt;code&gt;rvest&lt;/code&gt; package and search for the right html selectors using the inspect tool of your web browser and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=de&#34;&gt;selector gadget&lt;/a&gt; for Google Chrome. After that I wanted to immediately jump in and find use-cases at work to implement my new knowledge. One task that came to mind is rather dull and administrative - and thus even more so a good candidate for automation. Within the process of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/projections/html/index.en.html&#34;&gt;macroeconomic projection exercises&lt;/a&gt; the special team coordinating the exercises circulates well in advance of the next projection round a propose calendar outlining the timeline of forecast iterations and high-level meetings. Building on top of this general FTF (Forecast Task Force) calendar, my division, responsible for the projections for the largest five euro area countries, creates another one with more intermediate steps that are relevant for the country experts producing the forecast hands-on. As a guide for when might be the right time to work on the forecast we also enter in this calendar a column with the release dates of important macroeconomic indicators. For a long time this was a rather manual job, which could cost you a few hours to get all the data ready, oftentimes in an otherwise busy period.
The statistical offices &lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/news/internet-calendar&#34;&gt;Eurostat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.istat.it/en/information-and-services/journalists/release-calendar/press-room-calendar&#34;&gt;Istat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ine.es/en/daco/daco41/calen_ics_en.htm&#34;&gt;INE&lt;/a&gt; all offer internet calendars, which can be imported to Outlook, but also be read using the &lt;code&gt;calendar&lt;/code&gt; package. The national statistical offices of the Netherlands (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbs.nl/&#34;&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;) and Germany (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.destatis.de/DE/Home/_inhalt.html&#34;&gt;Destatis&lt;/a&gt;), howevever, only offer their release dates as lists or tables on the website.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.destatis.de/SiteGlobals/Forms/Suche/Termine/EN/Terminsuche_Formular.html&#34;&gt;annual calendar of Destatis&lt;/a&gt; is in particular tricky, because the list is split over multiple pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/destatis_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;page content split over multiple pages accessible via navigation buttons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let‚Äôs get to that part later. First let‚Äôs just find the selector for the data releases. Using the inspect tool of the browser we see that the items we are interested in are contained within the a div of class &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; within a div of class &lt;code&gt;c-result&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/destatis_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;css selector for the required data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let‚Äôs start getting our hands dirty in R and load the &lt;code&gt;rvest&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This output still has some issues that should be fixed, like the abundance of line breaks and whitespace, but we can leave this for later. The fact that we have a character vector of length 10 is already going in the direction that we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the question is how we can get to the next pages programatically. For this we will inspect the ‚Äúnext‚Äù arrow at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;images/destatis_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;html attribute of the navigation button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the forward button is an element with the class &lt;code&gt;forward button&lt;/code&gt; and has as an &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute the URL of the next page, however as a relative address (i.e.¬†without the base URL). If you would check on the last possible page of the list, you can see that the (now greyed out) forward button now does not contain an href attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can define a loop that starts on the first page, reads the data as well as the URL of the following page from the forward button (using &lt;code&gt;html_attr(&#34;href&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;) and then updates the page from which to read. This loop is repeated (with the data appended to the previously scraped data) until the last page is reached where the aforementioned command will return a missing value.
As discussed before, the content of the rows is a little problematic due to line breaks and spaces, but otherwise is quite structured. Using some string operations and regular expressions we can split the information into three columns, containing the name of the indicator, the reference period of the data release, and the release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;base_url &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://www.destatis.de/&amp;quot;

      <title>The ECB Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS)</title>
      <link>https://alex.melemenidis.de/post/2021-02-07-the-ecb-cts/</link>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://alex.melemenidis.de/post/2021-02-07-the-ecb-cts/index.en_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Things had already been moving in the right direction in the recent years: for a number of years our annual written special surveys, making use of our CTS contacts, had been published in the Economic Bulletin, exploring the views of the non-financial corporate sector on various topics such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/html/eb201606.en.html#IDofChapter2_4&#34;&gt;trade patterns and global value chains (2016)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/html/eb201706.en.html#IDofBox5&#34;&gt;structural reform needs (2017)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2018/html/ecb.ebbox201807_04.en.html&#34;&gt;digitalisation (2018)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2019/html/ecb.ebbox201907_04~1d48c6bf77.en.html&#34;&gt;price setting behaviour (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, and lastly the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2021/html/ecb.ebbox202008_06~bad87fcf9b.en.html&#34;&gt;long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic (2021)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Likewise, in line with the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/transparency/html/eb-communications-guidelines.en.html&#34;&gt;transparency guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, the annual meetings of the ECB Governing Council with selected high-level representatives of our surveyed companies has been part of the public calendar as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/devel/html/nfbd.en.html&#34;&gt;Non-Financial Business Sector Dialogue (NFBD)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
So far, however, outside observers would not know how these contacts with stakeholders of the real economy were established in the first place. This was now cleared up with the publication of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202101_01~2760392b32.en.html&#34;&gt;article and a box&lt;/a&gt; in the Economic Bulletin Issue 1/2021:
every quarter a small team of ECB staff is contacting a small sample of large non-financial corporations active across the Euro area in order to gain insights in to the current state of the business cycle in their sector, i.e.¬†in the last quarter, their expectations for the current quarter and what factors are behind these developments. This is an extremely interesting project, which also forces interviewers to familiarise themselves with sector-topical issues, to be well prepared for the short phone interviews with our busy counterparts, often high-level executives such as the CFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am personally involved in the teams dealing with two sectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transport and logistics services, which includes operators of infrastructure such as ports, airports and motorways, and service providers such as airlines, shipping companies and providers of supply-chain logistics solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intermediate goods manufacturing, which includes producers of basic metals, chemicals, packaging solutions and more elaborate components further used in other industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy that this work, which provides important information feeding in to the ECB‚Äôs monetary policy, is finally publicly acknowledged.
For more information, read the article and box on the ECB website &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202101_01~2760392b32.en.html&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I received the notification that an issue with the &lt;code&gt;dbplyr&lt;/code&gt; package in R, for which I had contributed to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/issues/534&#34;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;, was closed and that the great Hadley Wickham had updated the code! üòé&lt;br /&gt;
I was using the package at work for the preparation of a big data project and wanted to let the Hadoop system do the heavy lifting for the computation of some summary statistics and was going crazy over why my operations were not working. I was quite pleased to find out that this was a bug and that I could help describe it more precisely. I am not sure Hadley‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; minimal reproducible example was meant as a criticism or not, but I will try to be more minimal in the future! üòÑ&lt;br /&gt;
Can‚Äôt wait until the code change is also reflected on CRAN, as loading a package from GitHub at work is a bit more tricky‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shall not be the last time! At work we still have an issue using the &lt;code&gt;gtrendsR&lt;/code&gt; package through the proxy due to some specific settings we have. Might be best if we just fork and do a pull request. And get mentioned as contributors‚Ä¶ üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecb-survey-of-professional-forecasters-for-the-first-quarter-of-2021&#34;&gt;ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest survey round of the SPF, conducted between 7 and 11 January, respondents continued to cite the developments of the Covid-19 pandemic as the most important factor influencing their macroeconomic outlook for the euro area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation expectations remained broadly stable in the short-term, but a stabilisation could be observed for longer-term expectations.&lt;br&gt;
As regards real economic activity, GDP growth forecasts for 2021 were revised down, while those for 2022 were revised up, indicating that with recent surge in infections and associated new lockdown measures, respondents to the survey now expect the economic recovery to set in later, but then last longer. As a special question we asked respondents for their quarterly growth profile and around 20 respondents indicated that on average they expect GDP to have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to stagnate in the first quarter of 2021.&lt;br&gt;
Unemployment expectations were revised down across all horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/survey_of_professional_forecasters/html/ecb.spf2021q1~041e9cfa36.en.html&#34;&gt;full report on the ECB website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last holiday period under Covid-19 restrictions was certainly different than in other, normal years. On the one hand I had more time available, as I consumed unused leave days before they would expire, but at the same time I could not meet my old hometown friends as often as I wanted or go to the fantastic christmas market of Braunschweig, which is normally a highlight of the holidays. So I restricted myself to one outside meetup with my friends for a walk in the park, otherwise played UNO or Yahtzee with my parents, my brother and his girlfriend and otherwise spent my time digitally to stay productive and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned to use &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; to build this very personal homepage from the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;book by Yihui Xie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I freshened up my knowledge of &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;, as this might come in handy at work soon. The book &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html&#34;&gt;Mastering Shiny&lt;/a&gt; by Hadley Wickkham, while still in development, is now much more advanced than the first time I looked into it for a project during my MSc program in late 2019. With my new knowledge on Git I even made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/pull/350&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to contribute to the book (albeit only a small fix)!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally managed to finish editing a video of a canoeing weekend in August (see below). The trip was a way for our dragonboat group to keep paddling on a weekend that would otherwise be spent on the river Main competing in the Frankfurt Museumsuferfest. Hopefully the vaccinations go ahead fast so that we can return to normality by end of August 2021!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With 2021 it seems we will have new legislation on drones, which may require getting a license. Since this is currently possible for free at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lba-openuav.de/&#34;&gt;Luftfahrtbundesamt&lt;/a&gt;, I also did the online training for the A1/A3 open sub category. New travels and amazing travel videos to come soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Monday I am back in the (home) office, but the lockdown will continue until at least the end of the month. So more (forced) time for getting things done!&lt;/p&gt;
