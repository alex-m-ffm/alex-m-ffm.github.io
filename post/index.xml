&lt;p&gt;Things had already been moving in the right direction in the recent years: for a number of years our annual written special surveys, making use of our CTS contacts, had been published in the Economic Bulletin, exploring the views of the non-financial corporate sector on various topics such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/html/eb201606.en.html#IDofChapter2_4&#34;&gt;trade patterns and global value chains (2016)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/html/eb201706.en.html#IDofBox5&#34;&gt;structural reform needs (2017)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2018/html/ecb.ebbox201807_04.en.html&#34;&gt;digitalisation (2018)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2019/html/ecb.ebbox201907_04~1d48c6bf77.en.html&#34;&gt;price setting behaviour (2019)&lt;/a&gt;, and lastly the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2021/html/ecb.ebbox202008_06~bad87fcf9b.en.html&#34;&gt;long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic (2021)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Likewise, in line with the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/transparency/html/eb-communications-guidelines.en.html&#34;&gt;transparency guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, the annual meetings of the ECB Governing Council with selected high-level representatives of our surveyed companies has been part of the public calendar as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/devel/html/nfbd.en.html&#34;&gt;Non-Financial Business Sector Dialogue (NFBD)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
So far, however, outside observers would not know how these contacts with stakeholders of the real economy were established in the first place. This was now cleared up with the publication of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202101_01~2760392b32.en.html&#34;&gt;article and a box&lt;/a&gt; in the Economic Bulletin Issue 1/2021:
every quarter a small team of ECB staff is contacting a small sample of large non-financial corporations active across the Euro area in order to gain insights in to the current state of the business cycle in their sector, i.e. in the last quarter, their expectations for the current quarter and what factors are behind these developments. This is an extremely interesting project, which also forces interviewers to familiarise themselves with sector-topical issues, to be well prepared for the short phone interviews with our busy counterparts, often high-level executives such as the CFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am personally involved in the teams dealing with two sectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transport and logistics services, which includes operators of infrastructure such as ports, airports and motorways, and service providers such as airlines, shipping companies and providers of supply-chain logistics solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intermediate goods manufacturing, which includes producers of basic metals, chemicals, packaging solutions and more elaborate components further used in other industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy that this work, which provides important information feeding in to the ECB’s monetary policy, is finally publicly acknowledged.
For more information, read the article and box on the ECB website &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202101_01~2760392b32.en.html&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I received the notification that an issue with the &lt;code&gt;dbplyr&lt;/code&gt; package in R, for which I had contributed to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/issues/534&#34;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;, was closed and that the great Hadley Wickham had updated the code! 😎&lt;br /&gt;
I was using the package at work for the preparation of a big data project and wanted to let the Hadoop system do the heavy lifting for the computation of some summary statistics and was going crazy over why my operations were not working. I was quite pleased to find out that this was a bug and that I could help describe it more precisely. I am not sure Hadley’s &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; minimal reproducible example was meant as a criticism or not, but I will try to be more minimal in the future! 😄&lt;br /&gt;
Can’t wait until the code change is also reflected on CRAN, as loading a package from GitHub at work is a bit more tricky…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shall not be the last time! At work we still have an issue using the &lt;code&gt;gtrendsR&lt;/code&gt; package through the proxy due to some specific settings we have. Might be best if we just fork and do a pull request. And get mentioned as contributors… 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters - 2021 Q1</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecb-survey-of-professional-forecasters-for-the-first-quarter-of-2021&#34;&gt;ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest survey round of the SPF, conducted between 7 and 11 January, respondents continued to cite the developments of the Covid-19 pandemic as the most important factor influencing their macroeconomic outlook for the euro area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation expectations remained broadly stable in the short-term, but a stabilisation could be observed for longer-term expectations.&lt;br&gt;
As regards real economic activity, GDP growth forecasts for 2021 were revised down, while those for 2022 were revised up, indicating that with recent surge in infections and associated new lockdown measures, respondents to the survey now expect the economic recovery to set in later, but then last longer. As a special question we asked respondents for their quarterly growth profile and around 20 respondents indicated that on average they expect GDP to have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to stagnate in the first quarter of 2021.&lt;br&gt;
Unemployment expectations were revised down across all horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/survey_of_professional_forecasters/html/ecb.spf2021q1~041e9cfa36.en.html&#34;&gt;full report on the ECB website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lockdown productivity</title>

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last holiday period under Covid-19 restrictions was certainly different than in other, normal years. On the one hand I had more time available, as I consumed unused leave days before they would expire, but at the same time I could not meet my old hometown friends as often as I wanted or go to the fantastic christmas market of Braunschweig, which is normally a highlight of the holidays. So I restricted myself to one outside meetup with my friends for a walk in the park, otherwise played UNO or Yahtzee with my parents, my brother and his girlfriend and otherwise spent my time digitally to stay productive and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned to use &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; to build this very personal homepage from the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;book by Yihui Xie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I freshened up my knowledge of &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;, as this might come in handy at work soon. The book &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html&#34;&gt;Mastering Shiny&lt;/a&gt; by Hadley Wickkham, while still in development, is now much more advanced than the first time I looked into it for a project during my MSc program in late 2019. With my new knowledge on Git I even made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny/pull/350&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to contribute to the book (albeit only a small fix)!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally managed to finish editing a video of a canoeing weekend in August (see below). The trip was a way for our dragonboat group to keep paddling on a weekend that would otherwise be spent on the river Main competing in the Frankfurt Museumsuferfest. Hopefully the vaccinations go ahead fast so that we can return to normality by end of August 2021!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With 2021 it seems we will have new legislation on drones, which may require getting a license. Since this is currently possible for free at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lba-openuav.de/&#34;&gt;Luftfahrtbundesamt&lt;/a&gt;, I also did the online training for the A1/A3 open sub category. New travels and amazing travel videos to come soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Monday I am back in the (home) office, but the lockdown will continue until at least the end of the month. So more (forced) time for getting things done!&lt;/p&gt;
